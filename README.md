## 2. 🚀 Showcase

This snippet showcases a bot with a minimal API-style `/square` command and includes a module-based `/greet` command.

<details>
<summary>Required usings omitted for readability, click here to show</summary>

```cs
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

using NetCord;
using NetCord.Services.ApplicationCommands;
using NetCord.Hosting.Gateway;
using NetCord.Hosting.Services.ApplicationCommands;
```

</details>

### Minimal API-style Bot Example

The following example sets up a bot with a minimal API-style approach for the `/square` command, which calculates the square of a number:

```cs
var builder = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
    .UseDiscordGateway()
    .UseApplicationCommands<ApplicationCommandInteraction, ApplicationCommandContext>();

var host = builder.Build()
    .AddSlashCommand("square", "Square!", (int a) => $"{a}² = {a * a}")
    .UseGatewayEventHandlers();

await host.RunAsync();
```

Of course, you can also use the bare-bones approach.

### Module-based Command Example

Moreover, you can use a module-based approach. Here's an example of a `/greet` command that greets a specified user:

```cs
public class GreetingModule : ApplicationCommandModule<ApplicationCommandContext>
{
    [SlashCommand("greet", "Greet someone!")]
    public string Greet(User user) => $"{Context.User} greets {user}!";
}
```
